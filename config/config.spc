  # Each paths argument is a list of locations to search for a particular file type
  # Each paths can be configured with a local directory, a remote Git repository URL, or an S3 bucket URL
  # Wildcard based searches are supported, including recursive searches
  # Local paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD)

  # For example, for the json_paths argument:
  #  - "*.json" matches all JSON files in the CWD
  #  - "**/*.json" matches all JSON files in a directory, and all the sub-directories in it
  #  - "../*.json" matches all JSON files in in the CWD's parent directory
  #  - "steampipe*.json" matches all JSON files starting with "steampipe" in the CWD
  #  - "/path/to/dir/*.json" matches all JSON files in a specific directory
  #  - "/path/to/dir/main.json" matches a specific file

  # If paths includes "*", all files (including non-required files) in
  # the CWD will be matched, which may cause errors if incompatible file types exist

  # All paths arguments default to CWD
