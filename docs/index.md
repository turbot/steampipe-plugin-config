# Config + Steampipe

Config plugin is used to parse various types of files to represent the content as a SQL table.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

Query all data in your INI files:

```sql
select
  path,
  section,
  key,
  value
from
  config_ini;
```

```sh
> select section, key, value from config_ini where section = 'Settings';
+----------+---------------+-------------------------------------------+
| section  | key           | value                                     |
+----------+---------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Settings | DetailedLog   | 1                                         |

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/config/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Config plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install config
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest config plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/config.spc`) with a single connection named `config`:

```hcl
connection "config" {
  plugin = "config"
  
  # Paths is a list of locations to search for files. Each file will be
  # converted to a table. Wildcards are supported per
  # https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match
  # Exact file paths can have any name. Wildcard based matches must have an
  # extension of .ini (case insensitive).
  paths = [ "/path/to/dir/*", "/path/to/exact/custom.ini" ]

```

- `paths` - A list of directory paths to search for files. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match). File matches must have the required extension, i.e. `.ini` (case insensitive).
